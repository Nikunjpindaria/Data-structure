# 🚀 DSA in Java

This repository contains Java and C solutions for popular Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Files are organized by topic like arrays, strings, and graphs.

```bash
# 📁 Folder Structure:
dsa/
├── arrays/     // Array problems
├── strings/    // String problems
├── graphs/     // Graph algorithms (Kruskal's in C)

# ✅ Topics Covered:
Arrays – Find maximum element, reverse an array, second largest element, remove duplicates (sorted), left rotate by one, Kadane's Algorithm, move zeros to end, prefix sum problems  
Strings – Longest palindromic substring, anagram check, frequency count, reverse words, valid palindrome, remove consecutive duplicates, first non-repeating character, string compression, check if rotation, subsequence check, remove vowels, isomorphic string check  
Graphs – Kruskal’s Algorithm (written in C)
